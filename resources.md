# README Resources

A README file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file. There are many great README templates available on GitHub.

While creating your README file it is important for you to focus on :
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. I hope this reource is helpful for you in the process of building you own ultimate README page for your project.
